Coppermine,4,Ubers and Legends
"Divine Coppermine is a decent anti-Floating Support unit and an okay generalist Backliner, with 75% chance to Freeze Floating enemies for 4.67 to 5.6 seconds depending on treasures. She has 45k HP, 5300 DPS, 410 range, 3 KBs and 7 Speed. She also has a 3720 cost and a 66 second recharge. Before true form she is worse in just about every way and not relevant to the game today."
"Coppermine works fine against Floating enemies. She outranges most common Floating enemies, thus making her stay safe behind your meatshields while doing great Crowd Control on them, this good range giving her a slight edge over the anti-Floating Rares and Super Rares. For general usage, Coppermine is just an average Backliner Uber, still usable but nothing impressive. The only thing that makes her stand out compared to other general Backliner is her cheaper cost and fast recharge, making it much easier to send her out."
"Despite being able to provide constant good control towards Floating, Coppermine isn't much desirable as her role is replaceable and even outclassed by most anti-Floating Rares and Super Rares, such as Sanzo Cat, Cameraman Cat, Octopus Cat and Fishman Cat. This makes it not worth the cost to True Form her. Besides, her usage as a general Backliner falls off in late-game due to unimpressive stats, and being outclassed by some no gacha options such as Awakened Ururun Cat by late-game."
"In a nutshell, despite being able to stall Floating enemies quite well, she doesn't stand out due to how powercrept the Floating trait is, and her role can be fulfilled by Rares and Super Rares. Coppermine also doesn't have impressive stats, so she's very replaceable as a generalist."
