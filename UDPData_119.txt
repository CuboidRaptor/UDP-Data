Wyvern,4,Ubers and Legends
"Wyvern is a decent midrange anti-Black attacker, with 39k HP and 3 KBs, 27k base Damage every 4 seconds for 6700 base DPS at 370 range, 4470 cost, 95 second CD, and Massive Damage towards Black enemies."
"Wyvern's above average base DPS paired with Massive Damage (27k effective DPS) allows him to get rid of many strong Black enemies easily. While Black enemies are known to have high KB counts and this can cause many cats to miss their attacks, Wyvern has a short attack frequency, allowing him to control crowds of enemies, or recover quickly from a missed attack and return to dealing damage soon. He also has a relatively short CD, meaning you can get him back on the field soon after death, or have multiple of him at once easily."
"One main weakness of Wyvern is his survivability. While he does have a decent KB count that allows for some repositioning, his subpar HP and lowish range are often insufficient for common fast-pushing swarms of Black enemies. He also has a large competitor in nuking Black enemies: Pizza Cat. While Wyvern has more range than Pizza Cat which often gives Ubers an edge in some situations over their Rare/Super Rare competitors, there are no regular Black enemies who Wyvern outranges that Pizza doesn't, making it almost pointless here."
"Overall, Wyvern's stats are not the complete worst and it is decent at dealing with Black enemies, but is not used too often due to the existence of Pizza Cat, who does the job better in essentially all situations."
