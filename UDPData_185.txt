Hearscht,4,Ubers and Legends
"Hearscht is a situational Single Target critical hitter who resists Metal enemies. She has a 40% chance to Critical Hit for 20.4k Damage from a comfortable 345 range, and has 42.5k base HP with 3 KBs. She has an 81.2s Cooldown with a 2550 summon cost. It is highly recommended to unlock her True Form, especially considering that it requires few Catfruits like most collab True Forms, as before this the HP is lower and the crit rate is halved."
"Although she cannot realistically compete with non-Ubers when it comes to cooldown and price, her other stats are good for an anti-Metal. The 212.5k effective Health is fantastic, the range is plenty workable for Metal enemies, the attack rate is fairly fast, and the damage is great as well. Hearscht can be seen as a stronger, more expensive version of Waitress. While she can’t hope to match the consistency of a 100% crit rate, her average anti-Metal DPS is still near double Waitress’s on average, and higher than even Soba’s (by about 55%), making the risk often worth it."
"Hearscht’s main weaknesses are her somewhat unreliable critical chance and, of course, Single Target attack. While these are certainly not unimpactful, they’re mostly offset by the unit’s other strengths as an anti-Metal. Crazed Moneko outclasses Hearscht by a good margin, though the higher range + health and shorter animation can still give the latter an advantage in some situations. Of course, as with most critical hitters, the base stats are also too low (1600 DPS) to function outside of Metals and so general use is not recommended for Hearscht."
"Hearscht shouldn’t be the first pick when reliability or low cost are important, and despite the good stats she doesn’t stand that far above the Uberless alternatives. Still though, Hearscht is a competent anti-Metal and is able to shine at pretty much any point in the game in this role."
