Mystica,4,Ubers and Legends
"Mystica is a poor Super Backliner with slow 13s attack rate and the Strong ability against Black enemies. She has 21.8k base Damage and 1700 base DPS at 690 range, and 25.5k Health with 3 KBs, 5700 cost, and a 128s CD."
"Mystica doesn’t have any notable strengths to her name. Her only redeeming factor is that, excluding her deployment cost and ability, all of her stats are better than Li’l Nyandam’s. This makes her a suitable replacement for the latter, though even then stages you’d consider bringing Nyandam to nowadays are few and far between, even disappearing entirely as you get farther into the game."
"Her damage and DPS are very low even when taking the range into consideration. Her health isn’t great either, and the ability is barely useful. Shorter-ranged Black enemies are already dealt with by Pizza and Bombercat, Kurosawah outranges her, and Le’noir is bulky enough that the bonus damage from Strong doesn’t really matter; the effective DPS is still a mere 3000. Her effective 64k HP is unremarkable for a unit with the Strong ability, too."
"There is little more to say about Mystica: she’s an old unit without much going for her, and as huge as her range may be, it isn’t enough to give her much reason to be used with her poor stats."
