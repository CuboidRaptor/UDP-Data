Kachi-Kachi,4,Ubers and Legends
"Kachiyama Assault Brigade is a rather bad overall Backliner, but with usable anti-Angel and Alien niches. They have 3400 base DPS, 54k base HP, 460 range, 48 Speed, a 71s Cooldown and 2 KBs. They target Aliens and Angels with a guaranteed Weaken (50% Power) for 4.67 to 5.6s depending on treasures as well as the Strong Against ability. The First Form is completely irrelevant, with poor range, stats and ability and will not be analyzed here."
"Their main strengths come from specialist use, with a guaranteed perma-weaken AoE debuff helping suppress two traits with hard-hitting enemies. Strong Against further grants them 6500 effective DPS and 270k effective HP against Aliens/Angels (with Weaken) which solidly outclasses most similar-range generalists."
"While this may seem decent on paper, Kachiyama suffers from many issues. Kachiyama's abnormally high speed is a prominent problem, which causes range clipping, moving in front of meatshields and general suicidal tendencies. Combined with a low 2 KBs, they often die too early without contributing much to the battle. Kachiyama also suffers from terrible generalist stats, with base DPS lower than even C. Baha and pre-TF Ururun, so that even overlooking their other issues they are not usable as a general backliner, and perform worse than most specialists in their niche. Weaken is also a rather underwhelming CC to apply, with Slow and Freeze being preferable in most cases."
"Overall, Kachiyama Assault Brigade is a terrible generalist with bad base stats. Despite having a usable niche, they are dragged down by their suicidal speed and low KB count, and are more or less replaceable by other specialists even ignoring that. While you may find some occasional usage with Kachiyama Assault Brigade in their niche, they are never the best choice and overall a bad uber."
