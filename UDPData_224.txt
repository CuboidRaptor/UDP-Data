DONALD MORDEN,4,Ubers and Legends
"DONALD MORDEN is a decent backline anti-Alien Support unit. He has 47.8k base HP with 3 KBs and 24.3k Damage at 410 range, with 5400 DPS, and a 4.5s attack cycle. He has both Resistance against Alien and has a 40% chance of KB against them, and has an average 2 minute Cooldown with 4275 cost."
"MORDEN's Knockback attacks paired with his Resistance (200k+ effective HP) make him an effective unit for pushing Aliens. With a quick attack cycle and decent proc rate, he is able to gradually gain ground against most unstarred Aliens with ease over the course of battle, and not die while doing so. Aside from his anti-Alien abilities, MORDEN has decent use as a standard backline attacker. His base stats are similar to pre-True Form Ururun Cat with a bit more HP and less range, and he can be used similarly in the early to mid game to a degree."
"While MORDEN does not have any massive weaknesses, Knockback is a double-edged sword that can keep your units alive in some instances, but can also cause them to push into range of backline enemies, a common occurrence in many Alien-heavy or mixed stages. MORDEN can also struggle versus certain Starred Aliens due to his lack of Warp Immunity, diminishing his defensive capabilities and potentially losing the ground gained from his KB attacks. Lastly, his average generalist stats just don't hold up in the late game, and are obsoleted even by free units like Ururun's True Form."
"DONALD MORDEN is a satisfactory anti-Alien Uber throughout most of the game and his general usage is decent in 1* SoL, but diminishes greatly afterwards. Having only Knockback as a method of CC makes him less desirable than other Support units in plenty of cases, which makes his anti-Alien performance somewhat underwhelming. Still though, in the right situations where KB is an effective option, he does well enough."
