Hallowindy,4,Ubers and Legends
"Hallowindy is a decent anti-Alien Nuker with Massive Damage against them. She has 4100 base DPS with a 2.7s foreswing and a 13.6s attack frequency, 38k HP with 6 KBs, 9 Speed, and a standing range of 435. She also has 4425 cost and a 98s CD."
"Hallowindy's high anti-Alien DPS of 16.3k (with full treasures) allows her to make quick work of most Alien enemies. She also has a very high knockback count, giving her many chances to reposition to the backline. Her standing range is also adequate for countering and nuking troublesome Alien enemies including midrange ones that your Rares/Supers might not handle so well, like Ursamajors, though not super-backline threats such as Overseer Nyandam."
"Hallowindy has several glaring weaknesses, the first of which is her low base HP. This partly nullifies her high KB count because in the late game, most enemies will be able to kill her in 2 or 3 hits regardless, not being able to fully utilize all her KBs. Despite having a relatively short cooldown, it is not able to compensate for how quickly she can die on stages with hard-pushing enemies. Her foreswing and TBA are also quite long, meaning she can miss her attacks or be interrupted before landing them, causing a fatal gap in your offense that allows the enemies to overrun your defenses unchecked. Finally, her overall low base stats means she has very little generalist usage and is easily outclassed by units such as Ururun."
"In conclusion, Hallowindy has a decent matchup against Aliens due to her high effective DPS from the relative safety of the backline, but is useless in all other applications due to her low base stats and poor survivability, attack frequency, and foreswing."
