Spooky Thundia,4,Ubers and Legends
"Spooky Thundia is a poor generalist Backliner and anti-Black Nuker with the ability to deal Massive Damage to Blacks. She has 4200 base DPS, 3s foreswing, 38k HP with 5 KBs, 425 standing range, 8 Speed, 4410 cost, and a 95s Cooldown. Her First Form has lower stats and is not relevant."
"Spooky Thundia's role is to deal out large amounts of damage to Black enemies in one burst, which she is alright in, as she has 17k effective DPS. This is particularly useful in countering Le'noir, which most anti-Black nukers cannot outrange. Her KB count is also quite high, having 4 chances to reposition herself to safety. Finally, she has a short CD, allowing her to be replaced quickly if she dies."
"Many of Spooky Thundia's main advantages are negated by her overall low base stats. Her low base HP means she usually won't be able to use all her KBs. Not only that, Black enemies tend to hit very hard, meaning she will die very quickly if pushed, usually before you can replace her. Low base DPS also means she is unusable outside of her niche, and even in her niche, Pizza Cat outclasses her in almost everything, except for Le'noir. Another major flaw she has is her long foreswing, which is particularly bad for Black enemies as they have low endurance and high pushing power, often causing her to miss or be interrupted without proper support."
"Spooky Thundia's subpar base stats combined with an extremely powercrept niche makes her a difficult unit to use. Her low base HP causes her to die easily and in the few stages where she is viable, she can be easily replaced by other units that can get the job done better such as Pizza Cat."
