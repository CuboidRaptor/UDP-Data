Crazed Yuki,4,Ubers and Legends
"Crazed Yuki is a mediocre Backliner with 420 range. In True Form, Crazed Catgirl Yuki (CC Yuki) has 54k HP with 5 KBs, 4600 DPS, 16 Speed and a 14 second attack frequency. She also has Massive Damage against Red and Black enemies. In True Form, CC Yuki also gains Slow Immunity as a bonus. Lastly, she has a 4320 deploy cost and 105 second recharge."
"CC Yuki works well as a backline anti-Red Nuker with 18.4k effective DPS with full treasures. As most Red enemies have rather low range and are quite tanky, CC Yuki could attack safely from a distance while taking out a huge portion of their HP with her great effective DPS. Besides that, with a high KB count, she can reposition when enemies reach her, thus improving her survivability, letting her live longer to dish out more overall damage. Slow Immunity also makes her perform well on enemies with the Slow ability such as Croakley."
"While she works well as an anti-Red Nuker, CC Yuki works terribly as a Black Nuker. Her long attack frequency causes her to be overwhelmed by Black enemies easily. She also has a suicidal speed, this causing her to clip whenever Black enemies get knocked back and receive a lot of damage, thus decreasing her survivability. Her usage against Le'noir is also terrible as she only outranges Le'noir by 10 and often speed clips into Le’noir’s range. There is no reason to bring CC Yuki against Black enemies at all due to nuking Blacks already being fulfilled very well by Pizza. Besides that, her general usage is also poor due to lower than average range as a Backliner and with mediocre DPS, is even replaceable by no-gacha options like pre-TF Ururun and C. Bahamut."
"In conclusion, Crazed Catgirl Yuki is only good as an anti-Red Nuker, her usage as an anti-Black Nuker or as a generalist Backliner being far from satisfactory, replaceable by more accessible options in both."
