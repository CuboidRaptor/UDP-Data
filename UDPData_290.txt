Sayaka Miki,4,Ubers and Legends
"Sayaka Miki is a decent Backliner with 67k Health, 2 KBs plus Survive, 400 range, 5800 DPS, 4230 cost, 118s Cooldown, a 5.73s attack frequency, and a +50% Strengthen that triggers at 50% HP."
"While Sayaka Miki already has decent base DPS, her Strengthen boosts it to a very good 8700 DPS. This makes her more than viable on most stages where Backliners are needed. Her lower-than-typical range for this role, while mostly a weakness, can let her stand inside of certain enemies' blindspots. Combined with her high endurance that lets her tank a bit, Sayaka Miki can work very well against LD enemies such as Dolphina on stages like No Return Flights."
"Sayaka's biggest weaknesses are her range and low knockback count. Her below-average range means she can't outrange backline enemies and generally stands at an unsafe range for most bosses. Her survivability is also hindered by her low KB count, and her Strengthen ability only activates at 50% HP, which puts her at her final normal KB. While she does have Survive, she will immediately die the next time she is hit, rendering the bonus knockback useless against LD/wave/surge enemies."
"Sayaka Miki mostly works well in her role as a Backliner and can rarely be used as a Midranger. She's sufficient for a fair number of stages in her niche, but struggles on some key stages due to her low standing range for a Backliner and low KB count."
