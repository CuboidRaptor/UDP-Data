Mami Tomoe,4,Ubers and Legends
"Mami Tomoe is a terrific backline anti-Angel Sniper unit. She has a standing range of 475, along with 300 to 700 LD range, 45k HP and 4 KBs. She does Massive Damage against Angels as well as a great 4400 base DPS. Her cost is 4410, which is around the same as other backline Snipers (like Aphrodite or Archer), and she has a 2 minute CD."
"Mami Tomoe can deal with most problematic and common Angel backliners with her 18k effective DPS, such as Sleipnir, Chickful A, and Cala Maria, as well as shorter ranged enemies like Winged Pigge and Angelic Gory. She also does great as a general Sniper with her decent piercing range and good DPS, as she can wipe the enemy backline given enough support. Her survivability is also alright, with 3 chances to reposition. Her respectable cooldown with her great range means she can be stacked nicely."
"Mami Tomoe's blindspot is rather large, which can be quite detrimental because Angels are known to be notorious pushers. She can also be quite susceptible to being cursed, as Relics pair up frequently with Angels in UL. Her mediocre base health can also be unsafe, and let her die easier in comparison to other Snipers."
"Mami Tomoe is one of the best anti-Angel Ubers with heavy damage and great sniping capabilities. She has above-average stats for a generalist backline Sniper, and, despite her weaknesses, she's a great unit for almost any time of the game."
