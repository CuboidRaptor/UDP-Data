Kyoko Sakura,4,Ubers and Legends
"Kyoko Sakura is a mediocre anti-Red backline CC unit and attacker with 435 range and 5300 DPS. Her abilities consist of Weaken (50% power, 10s duration with full treasures) and KB against Red enemies, both with a 50% chance to proc. She has an approximate 2 minute Cooldown, 59k HP, 3 KBs, and a cost of 4290."
"Kyoko has a safe range that allows her to comfortably outrange most common Red frontliners. Her Weaken proc has an uptime of 131%, which can effectively stall pushing enemies. Additionally, this Weaken combined with her KB can easily halt Red enemies, who are notorious for being tanky pushers. Her generalist stats are fairly mediocre, but she is usable as a generalist Backliner, a better replacement for C. Baha/Ururun for early to mid-game"
"Kyoko's weaknesses consist mostly of a somewhat inconsistent proc rate. Her somewhat long attack rate with her non-guaranteed proc is questionable, and can be very dangerous. Furthermore, her compatibility with backliner enemies such as Professor A. is horrible; her KB and Weaken can possibly lead to “Mizli Syndrome” in stages such as Boiling Spring and A Day of Reckoning. Even outside of these specific cases, Weaken is just not the most useful proc to have against Red enemies as when this is relevant, Roe does it better while doubling as a tanker."
"Overall, Kyoko's support value can be usually replaced with various Rares and Super Rares such as talented Catley. To add on, her inconsistency with her abilities can decrease her value. However, her range can still allow her to shine from case to case. Her generalist stats are nothing to scoff at, but hardly stands out and can be easily replaced later in the game by the likes of Awakened Ururun, or stronger Uber generalists."
