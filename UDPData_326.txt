Mobius,4,Ubers and Legends
"Mobius is a decent anti-Red Uber with Massive Damage and guaranteed Knockback against Red. Mobius has 42k HP, 4500 DPS, ~6s attack frequency, 4 KBs and 445 range. Lastly, she has a 2 minute long recharge and 4470 cost."
"Mobius counters Red enemies quite well. With her guaranteed Knockback and good effective DPS (18k with ItF treasure), she can easily halt the push of Red enemies and kill them. Her moderate attack rate ensures she does not KB too frequently and cause your other units to suicide. Mobius also outranges most Red enemies, notable exceptions being Nyandam and Professor A, and does her job safely in the backline. And her decent KB count also ensures some survivability, both for her below average generalist performance and her higher quality anti-Red role."
"Mobius suffers from low base stats. She is more fragile compared to other Ubers, and she usually can't make use of all of her KBs. She also has lower base DPS compared to most Uber Backliners. While this problem is not significant on Red enemies as her DPS is amplified, this greatly reduces her usage as a general Backliner. She can easily be replaced by most Backliner Ubers, and in late game, she is even heavily outclassed by non-gacha units like Awakened Ururun."
"In conclusion, Mobius works well as a Red Nuker/CC Uber with great matchups against most of them, but she performs badly against non-Red enemies due to low base stats leading to underwhelming general backline attacker performance."
