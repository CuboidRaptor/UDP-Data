Lost World Yuki,4,Ubers and Legends
"Lost World Yuki is a decent Backliner with Massive Damage to Alien and Angel enemies. In True Form, Lost World Catgirl Yuki, has 445 range, 5 KBs, ~43k HP and 4300 base DPS. Lost World Catgirl Yuki also gains a guaranteed Barrier Break and Knockback Immunity in True Form. Her cooldown is 104.53 seconds."
"Lost World Catgirl Yuki is an ok Alien and Angel Nuker. With 445 range, she can outrange a good amount of Angel and Alien enemies, dealing a good 17.4k effective DPS, assuming full treasures. Having a guaranteed Barrier Break also makes her quite helpful against Starred Aliens. In addition to that, she can reposition easily with her high KB count. This greatly increases her survivability on the field. Lost World Catgirl Yuki also has a shorter than average cooldown. This makes it easier to send multiple of her and stack her DPS in a battle."
"Despite still being decent in nuking Angel and Aliens, Lost World Catgirl Yuki suffers from a below average base DPS. This makes her effective DPS on the lower end compared to most of the other anti-Alien/Angel Nukers. Besides, her role as a general Backliner suffers from lower than average DPS too and most other Ubers of the same role outclass her. This makes her very replaceable generally (still usable if all you have is Crazed Bahamut), and gets outclassed in late game by even no gacha options like Awakened Ururun. Her Knockback Immunity is also rather counter-productive as it robs her of some chances to reposition, making her die faster on a few stages."
"In conclusion, Lost World Catgirl Yuki can still counter Angel and Aliens well, outranging most recurring threats and nuking them with her good effective DPS. However, she is very replaceable in both her niches by other Ubers, although she’s still decent there if she’s all you got. As a general Backliner, she loses out to no-gacha options like Awakened Ururun by late-game, due to low base DPS."
