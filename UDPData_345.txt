Michelia,4,Ubers and Legends
"Naptime Michelia CC is a decent Backliner in True Form who can CC Floating enemies. She has 64k HP and 4 KBs, 5600 DPS at 415 range, 4500 cost, 135 second CD and Strong and 4s Freeze (100% proc chance) against Floating. Before True Form her Freeze is not guaranteed and her stats are lower across the board. Get True Form if you're going to use her, especially since it's a cheap collab TF."
"Michelia's biggest strength is the ability to consistently proc on Floating enemies. With a decently high 55% uptime and Strong to give her 160k effective HP and 10k effective DPS with full treasures, she is excellent at dealing with Floating enemies. She also outranges most Floating enemies very comfortably (aside from certain backliners such as Othom) and has very high durability in her niche, giving her an occasional advantage over Rare alternatives for Floating control like Sanzo. Her base stats are not too bad for generalist performance as a Backliner, with solid HP and slightly above average DPS."
"While her CC ability is good by itself, it is overshadowed by many spammable anti-Floating units, such as Cameraman, Sanzo and Fishman who deal with most Floating-heavy stages fine. She will still make Floating threats easier to deal with, but you would probably manage fine without her too. Her standing range is more than sufficient for her CC job, but is a little below par for a Backliner, making her a bit less safe overall in general use compared to alternatives."
"Overall, Michelia is a nice Backliner and anti-Floating CC unit, but is simply overshadowed heavily by many non-Ubers, similar to the majority of anti-Floating units in the game. Michelia brings nothing new or drastic to break away from this common drawback of her peers."
