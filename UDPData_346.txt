Todomeki,4,Ubers and Legends
"Todomeki is a Backliner with 440 range, 5100 DPS with a 6.6s attack cycle, 3900 cost and 41k HP. She has 50% chance to Slow Zombies and Aliens for 4.8 seconds with full CotC treasure. Like most Zombie-targeting units, she possesses the Zombie Killer ability."
"Todomeki's 440 range allows her to comfortably outrange all but the longest-ranged Zombie enemies. Her decent KB count allows her to reposition as needed, and when combined with her quick foreswing and relatively fast attack cycle, it grants her the opportunity to react well to any unburrowing or reviving Zombies. Her Slow proc has a decent 73% uptime, and is effective especially at controlling fast Aliens such as LeMurr and General Gregory. Her base stats allow adequate use as a general Backliner outside of her traits, with notably good cost-efficiency for her role."
"Unfortunately for Todomeki, her niche competes directly with talented Psychocat who is easily stackable. There are only a few situations where you would consider using her over Psychocat as most Zombies and a vast majority of the strong Alien pushers are also outranged by him (e.g. Star Peng, Mesocosmocyclone, Nimoy Bore. Even Ursamajor) giving Todomeki a hard time to shine, especially considering her proc is not guaranteed. She also is a bit too fast for her own good combined with a short backswing, meaning she will edge forward between attacks, move past your Erasers fairly often and expose herself to unnecessary damage."
"To wrap things up, Todomeki is a very balanced generic Backliner, essentially a better Crazed Bahamut, with an added bonus of CC vs two fairly compatible traits. Although she does somewhat struggle to shine when largely outclassed by a talented Rare, those who do not wish to commit the NP to Psychocat will find her a worthy substitute."
