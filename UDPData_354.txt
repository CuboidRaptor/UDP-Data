Seashore Kai,4,Ubers and Legends
"Seashore Kai is an okay frontline Tanker with 97k base HP, 8100 DPS, 2 KBs, 175 range, 15 Speed and a 71 second Cooldown. She has the niche of being an anti-Zombie/Black Tanker, with Resistance against those traits."
"Seashore Kai has 388k effective Health (485k effective Health with max ItF/CotC treasure) against her targeted traits, which is fairly good for tanking. She also has good speed for a tank, which allows her to reach the frontline quickly, and a suitably low cooldown for her role. Her main usage for Blacks are on some Razorback stages like Hearts of Darkness and Merciless XP, where she can act as a wall to protect your Bomber stack from aggressive peons. Against Zombies, she is good against Daboo and most Zamelle stages in particular, where tanking is often the best strategy. She is great to bring to Growing Strange as a hard carry for Seas of Death while also supporting in Hearts of Darkness."
"Seashore Kai has poor generalist stats, and tends to die before doing anything useful against enemies that she doesn't target. In her specialist usage, most Blacks have very high DPS and are spammed in great numbers, so it's almost pointless to try and tank them. While Zombies have less extreme DPS and spam rate, they are harder to deal with overall due to burrowing/reviving, higher endurance, and lack of CC options as good as Bomber to keep them under control. Her anti-Zombie tanking niche is also outclassed by Shigong, especially in True Form."
"Overall, she has some very niche usages in specific Black and Zombie situations but these are largely irrelevant with how well-countered Blacks are in general, and the existence of Shigong. Seashore Kai had a greater role in the meta in the past, but has been powercrept badly. Her stats fall behind regular Kai's by quite some distance, which is fatal for a Tanker as they rely on raw stats to be able to do their job at all well, meaning she has almost no general value unfortunately."
