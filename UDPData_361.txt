Aer,4,Ubers and Legends
"Aer isn’t very useful in First Form, but in Evolved/True Form, Aervanta is a decent Barrier Breaker unit with a combination of guaranteed chance to break barriers and Long Distance (LD) attack from 275 to 650 range while standing at 375. Base stats include 4600 DPS with a 4.7s attack frequency, 58k base HP with 2 KBs, and a 88s CD. Like all other Pixies, Aervanta also gain Resistance towards Aliens in Evolved/True Form and Warp Immunity in all forms. Talents add Dodge and Weaken abilities to extend Aer’s lifetime, but are not extremely useful."
"Aervanta is used as a Barrier Breaker unit. With LD attack and 275 piercing range, his attack can easily reach and break backliner barriers. Besides, Aervanta has a fairly quick attack frequency, which greatly amplifies his efficiency in breaking barriers. Aside from breaking barriers, Aervanta still has decent LD DPS that helps to cripple and kill Starred Alien backliners (as most of them tend to have lower HP) and substantial effective HP close to 300k. As for his general usage, Aervanta still works decently as an LD unit if you don't have better choices. With his quick recharge, you can easily send multiple Aervantas in a battle."
"The main flaw of Aervanta is that he is easily replaced by Golfer Cat and Kitty of Liberty. You can easily break frontline barriers with Liberty, and use Golfer for the backline. Besides, Aervanta has a low survivability due to below average standing range for a Sniper, and only one chance to reposition if enemies reach him, thus making his general usage rather unsatisfactory."
"In conclusion, Aervanta is a Barrier Breaker that can easily hit backline barriers, but his role is replaceable most of the time by Super Rares (Golfer and Liberty). His usage generally as an LD unit is still decent, but having a lower range and less reposition chances greatly reduce his survivability."
