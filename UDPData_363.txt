Rin Tohsaka,4,Ubers and Legends
"Rin Tohsaka is a mediocre backline attacker with Zombie Killer and a 50% chance to KB Aliens and Zombies. She has 44k HP with 4 KBs, 5300 DPS, 11 Speed, 450 range, 4260 cost, and ~2 min Cooldown. Her First Form has lower stats and is not relevant."
"Rin's KB ability against Aliens is alright for the most part, as she can control them without pushing so hard that it causes Mizli Syndrome. She also has a decent matchup against Cadaver Bear, as her KB proc can help save her if she can't get a damage KB. For most of the game, she can basically be used as an improved Crazed Bahamut with an overall better build at the same range. Her survivability is also good, having 3 chances to reposition and enough HP to make use of them."
"Rin Tohsaka's biggest flaw is her rather long foreswing, which can lead to her missing her attack. This also means that she usually won't be able to utilize her ability to KB Zombies as they burrow by the time her attack lands. What's worse is that her Zombie niche is already outclassed by Ectoweight, which can outrange almost everything she can. Her base HP also isn't quite adequate to deal with Zombies, which is a weakness compounded by her long foreswing, almost ensuring that she will take damage. Her Alien niche is only slightly better, as she only has average DPS for a Backliner and a 50% KB chance, meaning she has to rely on her KBs against tankier Aliens, and is unable to control them without help."
"Rin Tohsaka is a really simple unit without many unique skills or significant drawbacks, making her a rather uninteresting, but reliable Uber in the early game. She has really standard generalist stats and her lack of specialization means that she will be easily replaceable and get outclassed later on in the game when you want something more than just a backline damage dealer."
