Rider,4,Ubers and Legends
"Rider is a good anti-Angel CC unit with a guaranteed 3.6s Freeze with full relevant treasures. She has 41k HP with 3 KBs, 4600 DPS and 400 range. She also has a noticeably low cost of 3600 and a fast 71s Cooldown. Her First Form has lower stats and is not relevant."
"Rider does a great job of controlling hard-pushing Angels with her guaranteed Freeze, which has a solid uptime of ~60%. Her low cost and short cooldown also make her easy to stack to bolster her already good uptime and even achieve permafreeze. Her range sufficiently counters longer ranged Angels like Winged Pigge and Sleipnir that Rare/Super Rare options cannot control, and keeps her a safe distance from hard melee pushers like Boraphim or Angelic Gory swarms long enough to land a Freeze."
"The biggest problem with Rider is that outside of her niche, her stats are terrible. Her DPS is slightly subpar even for an average Backliner, yet her standing range is closer to midrange class, and she doesn't have any notable features to offset this outside of Angels. Her fast respawn helps to an extent, but she does not have the HP needed to consistently survive 70s in general use beyond the early stages of the game. In late game, the frequent mix of Angel and Relic threats with Curse mean that even her narrow niche is heavily eroded."
"Rider is nice to have for controlling Angels as there are few alternatives, especially from 400 range. She can pull her weight on most mid game Angel stages, but her other stats are far too low to use beyond this niche."
