Saki Nijima,4,Ubers and Legends
"Saki Nijima is a poor midrange Crowd Control unit with the core ability to Slow Black and Floating enemies for 3.33 seconds, or 4 seconds with full ItF fruit treasures. In True Form, Samba Saki CC has 71k HP with 5 KBs, 5900 DPS at 325 range, and Slow Immunity. She also has a 108 second recharge and 3900 cost. Before True Form, her stats are worse across the board and a slower attack rate reduces her uptime, so it isn't worth using."
"Samba Saki CC is usable as a Midranger if you are desperate for one, or in the early game, with average-ish DPS and at least somewhat more range than most non-Uber Midrangers. Her high KB count along with decent HP also allow her to reposition a lot, boosting her survivability."
"Saki Nijima's CC ability is completely outclassed by Sanzo Cat and Bombercat which are considerably more accessible options. Her general use suffers from DPS that is average at best, and an excessively long cooldown period not befitting the high-risk work of a Midranger."
"In conclusion, Saki Nijima is a nearly worthless unit both in her niche and as a generalist. Her CC is obsoleted by common units, and her stats and recharge are substandard making her a subpar generalist at best."
