Subaru Hoshi,4,Ubers and Legends
"Subaru Hoshi is a decent LD Uber with Strong against Red/Angel enemies. The True Form, Dark Subaru CC, has 48k base HP, base 4600 DPS with a 1.7s foreswing, 425 standing range, 300 to 625 LD coverage, 21 Speed and 4 KBs. Subaru has a 2 minute long Cooldown and 4140 cost. His Evolved Form has considerably worse stats and 25 less range but still works, just doing the same job less well."
"Dark Subaru CC counters Red and Angel enemies quite well. With full fruit treasures, he has 8300 effective DPS and 119k effective HP towards his target traits. For an LD Sniper this is rather powerful, and his high effective HP both allows some low level tanking and ensures he makes full use of his decent KB count, even against heavy hitters, letting him survive longer to output more overall damage. His piercing range is sufficient to deliver his substantial damage output to compatible-trait backliners like Professor A and Cala Maria with a stepping stone, which is his most unique and valuable use case. For general usage, Subaru works well as a general Sniper, due to decent base DPS and good range."
"One weakness of Subaru is his unusually high speed for an LD unit. This makes him often clip into the frontline when enemies get knocked back, exposing him to extra risk that his mediocre base HP might not be enough to withstand. Like many LD Ubers, he can suffer on stages with hard melee pushers as they can infiltrate his blindspot, and his somewhat long foreswing exacerbates this issue."
"In conclusion, Dark Subaru CC works well as an anti-Red/Angel Sniper. He has high enough HP to tank hits, while also dealing some serious damage. His weaknesses of somewhat low survivability outside his niche, and the usual LD blindspot issue, can be avoided with good support in most cases, making him quite respectable in general use too."
