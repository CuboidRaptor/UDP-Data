Miyabi Oyama,4,Ubers and Legends
"Baseball Mask Î´, the TF of Miyabi Oyama, is a good anti-Wave unit with 6000 base DPS at 380 range, 64k HP with 4 KBs, and a 50% Strengthen, triggering at half health. Her other stats are average, with 4020 cost, 111s CD, and 12 Speed. Evolved Form has worse stats and no Wave Immunity, so it is recommended to get the TF before using her."
"Miyabi Oyama works very well in her anti-Wave niche, outranging all recurring wavers. Even though her base DPS for her range is mediocre, it jumps to ~9000 once her Strengthen is activated, also making her a solid generalist Midranger. Her survivability is also good with a high KB count, and she distinguishes herself from many other Strengthen Ubers by having another chance to reposition even after her Strengthen is activated. A fast foreswing also helps her handle both wave and general stages with heavy pushers better, making her damage output consistently connect with the target you want."
"Miyabi Oyama doesn't have any glaring weaknesses. Her reliance on Strengthen at half HP to achieve full potency means she is either doing more mediocre DPS, or fairly close to death, at all times. Her cooldown is also a little on the long side for a Midranger, which isn't ideal given the inherent danger of the range class."
"Despite her minor weaknesses, Miyabi Oyama is a versatile unit, usable in almost all wave stages or as a serviceable general Midranger. She is essentially a direct upgrade on Musashi. By late game she faces competition from talented Dancer Cat whose fast cooldown reduces the value of mainstream Wave Immune Ubers."
