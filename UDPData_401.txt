Voli,4,Ubers and Legends
"Voli is a spammable (16.2s CD) anti-Alien CC unit with a 50% chance to proc Freeze for 3 seconds in First Form, 19k HP with 3 KBs, 320 range, 2.2k DPS and Warp Immunity. In True Form, Gigavolta becomes less spammable (83s CD) but gains a guaranteed 3.67s Freeze proc, Resistance to Aliens and Barrier Breaker. This makes him an excellent anti-Alien unit. Additionally, Gigavolta has 54k base HP with 3 KBs, 5700 DPS, 370 range, and 20 Speed. "
"Although Voli is more used in other forms, his First Form still works quite well. If paired with Seafarer Cat, it is easy to achieve permafreeze on Alien enemies quickly. In True Form, Gigavolta is a Midranger with ~60% Freeze proc uptime. With his >215k effective HP, low cost and CD, it's easy to always have him on the field, and permafreeze with just two unsynced Gigavoltas. Barrier Breaker helps a lot to let your units push too. Gigavolta still works decently well on mixed Alien + non-Alien stages, but more support is needed to prevent other traited enemies from reaching him."
"The only weakness of Gigavolta against Aliens is that he has a somewhat low range but even then, it doesn't matter most of the time on pure Alien stages since Gigavolta has the effective HP to tank a few hits from Backliners and then walk up to freeze them. Outside of Aliens, he simply lacks the stats to be effective as a midrange attacker and is outclassed by almost any generalist in his range class, and even many safer-range backliners."
"In conclusion, Voli is an excellent anti-Alien CC Uber that is useful in a lot of Alien stages throughout the game. His usage as a midranger isn't really recommended outside of the very early game, due to simple poor stats. He relies entirely on his abilities against Aliens for value. "
