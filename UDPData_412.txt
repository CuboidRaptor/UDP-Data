Eva Unit-00,4,Ubers and Legends
"Eva Unit-00 is a great Support Uber with Wave Blocker and 350 range, and also serves as a situational Tanker. She sports 127.5k base HP, and resists Angelic and Floating enemies. She has 4800 DPS, 2 KBs, and 11 Speed. She costs 4425, and has a very long cooldown (175s)."
"Eva-00 is a very simple, yet incredibly potent Uber. Thanks to her range, she invalidates nearly every wave enemy / stage in the game. She conveniently outranges every relevant wave enemy and her Wave Blocker allows you to maintain a steady flow of meatshields. You can play the stage as if it has no waves at all. She also has a secondary role as an anti-Angel / Floating Tanker. With 510 to 638k effective HP (depending on ItF fruit treasures), Eva-00 can tank enemies of her target traits for quite a while. Notably, it helps her against Sunfish Jones, who is seen on a handful of wave stages."
"Eva-00 might be a stellar Wave Blocker, but this ability comes at a massive cost. Her KB count hurts her survivability, her cooldown is absurdly long, and the DPS is utter garbage for a Tanker. While you could use her to tank for a while, she won't do much damage in return, and when she dies, she usually won't be even halfway recharged. As a Wave Blocker, Eva-00 has practically no flaw. The only stages where she'll actually struggle are those that have enemies with piercing range (e.g. Anatomy Forest, Floor 47). She can also get hit on stages with low-endurance wave enemies and backliners, but there aren't any noteworthy examples of this besides Floor 33, in which case alternatives such as Octopus Cat may be better."
"You are stuck on a stage. This stage has wave enemies. You bring Eva-00. You are no longer stuck on this stage. That's all you need to know about this Uber. She does have the additional ability to tank Angels or Floating enemies, but her stats are too lacking to fulfill this role properly."
