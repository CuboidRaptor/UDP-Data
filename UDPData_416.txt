Moon Operators,4,Ubers and Legends
"Moon Operators is a mediocre backline attacker and poor CC/Support unit at 450 range with 4600 DPS, a 3.3s foreswing and 9.2s attack rate, 42.5k HP and 4 knockbacks, and a 138s Cooldown. In addition, it has a 100% chance to Slow Red and Zombie enemies for 3.7s to 4.4s depending on treasures, as well as the Zombie Killer ability."
"There is not much to say about Moon Operators' strengths, as they are quite limited. It stands at an average backline range so it can outrange melee and midrange enemies, and the Slow duration is decent on paper."
"Moon Operators' Slow ability is very flawed in practice, however. With a fairly slow attack rate, it has a low Slow uptime of only ~40% (~48% with maxed out anti-Red and anti-Zombie Fruit Treasures). This is notably bad against recurring Red enemies such as Bore, J.K Bun Bun or Shy Boy, as they tend to be bulky pushers. Additionally, Moon Operators' long cooldown makes it hard to be stacked up quickly enough to achieve longer Slow durations. It is not a good anti-Zombie unit, either, due to its below average HP and long foreswing, rendering it vulnerable to Zombiesâ€™ burrows and ineffective against the high pushing power of Cadaver Bear. Lastly, Moon Operators has painfully average DPS, which prevents it from seeing usage as a backline attacker compared to competition."
"Overall, Moon Operators does not have anything of relevance going for it, as it does not perform significantly better than Bahamut Cat and pre-TF Ururun Wolf. Its CC ability is also mediocre at best due to being outshined by a large number of non-Uber CC units against both of its target traits. With below average stats across the board, bad compatibility against Zombie enemies and no other redeeming qualities, Moon Operators will perform poorly throughout the entire game."
