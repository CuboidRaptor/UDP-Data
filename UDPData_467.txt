Super Zeus,4,Ubers and Legends
"Super Zeus is an underwhelming CC unit with a guaranteed Weaken (to 50% power) against Traited enemies for 4 seconds while being Resistant to them. He has 31k HP with 5 KBs, 5100 DPS at 425 standing range, 9 Speed, 4800 cost, and a ~160 second Cooldown. He has immunities to KB, Freeze, Weaken, and Slow. Without True Form, he has even less health and shorter Weaken duration, so it is highly recommended to TF him before use."
"Super Zeus's guaranteed Weaken ability against all Traited enemies makes him very versatile and effective in mixed-Trait stages. His survivability against Traited enemies is also quite high, as he has 122 to 153k effective HP (depending on treasures) which allows him to make use of all of his KBs. His status immunities also increase his utility against a range of foes such as Calamary, Henry, and Croakley."
"Low uptime Weakens are notoriously ineffective, and Super Zeus suffers from this, with only around ~60% uptime at max, but often lower than this in reality due to his long foreswing making him whiff attacks. His cooldown is also obstructive to stacking him to help circumvent this weakness, though it can be done. His below average DPS for his standing range means you're unlikely to get much out of him as an attacker, and his low base HP gives him a big vulnerability to Traitless enemies in mixed stages and Curse in the late game."
"Super Zeus was made to be a jack-of-all-trades unit, but he fails at his niche, mainly because of his extremely low Weaken uptime. Although he is still usable, his low base stats leave much to be desired and he is easily replaceable. Thaumaturge will often give you a more reliable Weaken, and even no gacha Backliners like Crazed Bahamut and Ururun are better choices for general use."
