Super Devil,4,Ubers and Legends
"Super Devil, in True Form, is a very solid LD Sniper unit with the guaranteed ability to Slow Angels for 6 seconds, provided you have full treasures. He has 3400 DPS with a 2s foreswing, 51k HP with 5 KBs, 7 Speed, 4200 cost, a 2 min Cooldown, and most notably stands at the extremely comfortable range of 550 with an LD of 400 to 800, allowing him to hit almost all backline enemies. His other forms are not relevant as they have lower stats and 3 KBs instead of 5."
"Super Devil's Slow ability is able to control many problematic Angel pushers, his huge range allowing him to reach enemies such as Winged Pigge and Sleipnir, something that Sanzo and Juliet cannot do. This Slow effect is also quite long lasting, with around a 75% uptime with full treasures. Apart from having a unique niche, Super Devil has good generalist uses as a Sniper as his DPS is above average for his range and piercing distance. His 250 piercing range also gives him the ability to outrange almost all enemies with a stepping stone. Finally, he has excellent survivability, with 4 chances to reposition and a high base HP to make use of them, along with a slow movement speed, which prevents him from recklessly moving too close to the frontline."
"Super Devil's only major downfall is his LD, as his blindspot of 400 is quite large and lets many enemies infiltrate it, including many melee Angels. This drawback is partially remedied by the high survivability mentioned above. Despite having a good Slow uptime, his long-ish foreswing can cause him to miss enemies such as Angelic Gories and Gabriels, leading to him not landing the attack, although this is rare."
"Because of his long range, good survivability, and strong niche, Super Devil is an all-around amazing unit to have around. He will find uses throughout the whole game as a strong anti-Angel CC unit and with serviceable general stats that make him a decent Sniper to boot."
