Satanmaria,4,Ubers and Legends
"Satanmaria is a good Midranger with Massive Damage against Red as well as Wave Immunity. Her Evolved Form, Wondermaria, has 28 Speed, 29k HP with 4 KBs, and 7600 base DPS. Her First Form has 14 Speed and weaker stats. Both forms have a 5.2 second attack cycle, 1.5s of backswing, and 370 standing range, which is enough to outrange most common Red enemies. Her cooldown is 85s long."
"Wondermaria's main selling point is her high effective DPS against Red enemies, boasting 23k to 30k effective DPS depending on treasures. This allows her to take out even the tankiest Red enemies with ease. Wondermaria's Wave Immunity also makes her an excellent counter to Red wavers, namely Berserkory and Two Can; and her general DPS also offers good performance against other common wavers like Kory and Dober P.D. Her high speed in Evolved Form allows her to quickly reach the battle and dish out a good chunk of damage to enemies."
"However, Wondermaria's strengths come at the cost of abysmal survivability. Her high speed, low health, and short backswing compared to her attack cycle often cause her to run in front of your meatshields and bring about her own early death. This problem can be alleviated by using her First Form, Satanmaria, who has a much more manageable speed, though at the cost of weaker stats."
"Overall, Wondermaria is a great choice for quickly taking out Red enemies, and her Wave Immunity allows her to work as a solid anti-Wave Midranger. As long as she is protected well, she can be a very useful unit to have."
