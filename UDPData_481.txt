Doktor Heaven,4,Ubers and Legends
"Doktor Heaven has Insane Resistance against Blacks and Aliens in First Form, in Evolved Form there are no stat changes but it has Insane Damage instead of resist. Doktor has an astonishing 187k base Health and 3 knockbacks. She also has 46k base Damage and 5800 base DPS with an 8 second (240f) atk frequency. She also has an awkward 400 range and 5400 cost. Her main use is against her targeted traits, her First Form being a Tanker and Evolved Form being a backline Nuker. She has a cooldown of 168s."
"Her main strengths are her high health and abilities. Her First Form has an amazing 1.3M effective Health. Her Evolved Form has a great 270k effective Damage and 34k effective DPS. Her health in both forms is a great addition to her, giving her good survivability with her decent KB count. Her two traits are decent matchups, while tanking Black enemies isn't great, tanking Aliens is quite good. Her Evolved Form matchups are also quite good, as nuking Aliens and Blacks are a good counter to those two traits."
"Her main weaknesses are her awkward range and long attack frequency. Her range is incredibly weird, she can be considered a Backliner but outranges barely any backline enemies. Her long attack frequency can be extremely hurtful, mostly in Evolved Form, as 8 seconds is a large window of opportunity for enemies to push. Her long cooldown, while not being terrible, is still bad. She has a long cooldown, this greatly reduces her use as a Tanker and as a Nuker as it gives a gigantic window for enemies to push if she dies early on. Her knockback count can reduce her use in more late game stages too, with only 3 knockbacks her great health can be destroyed incredibly quickly."
"She is a decent general Backliner and a pretty great specialist. Despite her range and attack frequency, she can still dominate her traits in both forms, and despite countering Black, a powercrept trait, she is still very useful. Her Evolved Form is generally more usable in later game, and even most of the time in early game due to the range making her tanking use not as valuable."
