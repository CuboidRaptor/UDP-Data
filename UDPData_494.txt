Seabreeze Coppermine,4,Ubers and Legends
"Seabreeze Coppermine is a bad Midranger with a 50% chance to proc Freeze against Red, Black and Metal enemies for 3.7 to 4.4 seconds. In Evolved Form, S-Copper has 39k HP, 4700 DPS, 375 range, 7 Speed and 3 KBs. Lastly, she has 3720 cost and a 66 second Cooldown."
"The only strengths of S-Copper are her fast cooldown and cheap price, which makes her easier to be sent out and stacked. If you are desperate, then stacking several of her may overcome her weaknesses enough to make her useful."
"Seabreeze Coppermine is mostly useless as she has a ton of weaknesses. Her Crowd Control is extremely inconsistent with a mediocre proc rate and only 58% to 70% uptime when it actually connects. Additionally, her niche is heavily powercrept; Metal enemies can be dealt easily with True Forms of cyclone drop units, Black enemies with Bombercat; and for Reds you can just use iCat, Roe Cat, or some other Rares/Supers to much greater effect. As for general usage, her range is too low to work as a Backliner, and HP & DPS are too low to work as a good Midranger."
"In conclusion, Seabreeze Coppermine is worthless. Her CC is inconsistent on already powercrept traits, with too low stats to be used generally. Her weaknesses outweigh her strengths to the point where you should not use her unless you have no other CC for those traits, at which point you must stack her to make her at all reliable. Not even worth her deploy cost, truly a disappointing uber."
