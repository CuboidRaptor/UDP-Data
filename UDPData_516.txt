Dhalsim,4,Ubers and Legends
"Dhalsim is a terrible anti-Traitless CC Uber with the ability to Weaken Traitless enemies to 50% for 3s. His multi-hit delivers 3 attacks of equal damage, each attack separated by 7f (~Â¼ of a second). He has 71k HP with 5 KBs, 4600 DPS from 350 range, 6 Speed, 3750 cost, and a cooldown of 91s."
"Dhalsim honestly doesn't have much going for him. Weakening Traitless enemies is a rare niche, and his AoE gives him an advantage in it over competitors like Thaumaturge in certain situations with multiple threats. He has decent survivability, with 4 chances to reposition and a large base HP to make use of them, and he recharges quite quickly and has a pretty low cost, making him easy to replace or stack."
"To say Dhalsim has a lot of weaknesses is an understatement. First off, the Weaken proc has a terrible ~50% uptime. When units rely on Weaken as their CC, the uptime should be near-permanent to perform well. Thaumaturge, with a 150% uptime and only 40 less range, is able to more effectively Weaken everything Dhalsim can except for H. Nah. Even though Dhalsim can be stacked, it's basically never worth it because Thauma can already do his job better, especially against wave units like Dober PD and Kory thanks to a Wave Immune talent. Dhalsim's general stats are also completely unsalvageable, as his DPS is pitifully low for a midrange Uber. To add insult to injury, since each attack is only separated by a short time, his gimmicky multi-hit can end up reducing that number even lower if the enemies get knocked back before all 3 hits connect. His movement speed is also way too slow to infiltrate blindspots of enemies like Dolphina or Mr Mole."
"There really isn't much else to say other than the fact that Dhalsim fails horribly at his niche with too low uptime to be impactful, and range too low to compete with Thaumaturge. His general stats are also far too low to even consider using for anything else."
