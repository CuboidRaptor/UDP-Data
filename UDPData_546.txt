Papaluga,4,Ubers and Legends
"Sukelan Kakulan is a terrible Backliner with the ability to Curse all traits except Metal for 5s on each of its three multihits over a 12.5s attack cycle. It has a 4900 DPS at 475 range, a 224.5s Cooldown, 30.6k HP, and 1 KB. It is also Surge Immune and Curse Immune. Its Evolved Form has a shorter Curse and no Surge Immunity, and as always with Lugas the First Form is not usable."
"Papaluga has one mediocre strength: an above average standing range allowing it to counter enemies that barely outranged Crazed Bahamut and similar Ubers. Its 65% uptime Curse can be rarely helpful for support against Status enemies such as Winged Pigge, Angelic Sleipnir or Gobble but many of these are a threat due to their range and damage even if Curse is used to neutralize their special effects, and with a large gap in Papaluga's uptime you will often still suffer from them anyway."
"Papaluga suffers from typical Nekoluga weaknesses of horrible survivability and a ridiculously high cooldown. It dies when anything gets to it, and it frequently misses due to badly timed multi-hits, which decreases its Curse uptime and already underwhelming DPS further. Additionally, Curse as an ability is often overshadowed due to the limited number of enemies that use CC as their main threat. Surge Immunity is not relevant as its low stats and excessive cooldown make it not desirable to use even against Surge enemies."
"Papaluga is a near-useless unit with very little to no value throughout the whole game, due to it having a low-impact, unreliable ability and hugely underwhelming stats across the board. Overall, it is a greatly flawed and lacking Uber, who has all the weaknesses of a textbook Luga, but none of the strengths."
