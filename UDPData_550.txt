The 10th Angel,4,Ubers and Legends
"The 10th Angel is a bad anti-Angel unit, having 41k HP with 2 KBs, 1200 base DPS with a 16s attack frequency, 400 range, Massive Damage and guaranteed 2 to 2.4s Freeze proc against Angels, depending on treasures. The 10th Angel also has Omnistrike from -200 to 900 range, and 100% chance to create a level 2 Surge spawning in a range of 250 to 950 range, while having 3900 cost and 191s Cooldown."
"The 10th Angel has up to 3500 effective DPS, provided his surge fully connects, or 13.9k against Angels. He also has a huge 500 piercing range which can be useful for sniping enemies. This also combines well with his guaranteed Freeze, which lets him stop Angels from pushing for a short amount of time."
"Having a low KB count and mediocre standing range on top of low health, the 10th Angel has terrible survivability. With terrible base stats, the 10th Angel has almost no use outside of Angels. Unreliable surge spawn position can also make him regularly fail to deliver most of his DPS to a useful place. His Freeze is a nice bonus, but with a long TBA, it is not a reliable CC to depend upon with a mere 15% uptime."
"The 10th Angel is terrible in most situations, but there are a few moments when his support for Angels can help a bit, or where his piercing range may help, but for the most part he contributes nothing and can be easily replaced. A bad unit that has no real viable usages."
