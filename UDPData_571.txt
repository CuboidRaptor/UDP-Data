E. Honda,4,Ubers and Legends
"E. Honda is a poor melee anti-Angel Tanker with limited Crowd Control ability. He has 127.5k base HP and 3 KBs, 4200 DPS and 12.8k Damage with a 3s attack cycle and 3f foreswing, with Resistance and guaranteed Knockback against Angels. He stands at 230 range, with 63 Speed, a 91.2s Cooldown and 3675 cost."
"E. Honda packs massive bulk against Angel enemies, even at level 30, Resistance raising his effective HP to 510 to 638k (depending on ItF fruit treasures). He also has a quick attack frequency with short foreswing and full backswing. This means he can abuse rebounds from Angelic Sleipnir greatly, especially taking his tankiness into account. Guaranteed KB also allows him to push any Angel enemies that he can reach. These two combined, give him viability on some stages with exposed Sleipnirs â€” like No Plan A or Glittering Peaks."
"Even on paper one can tell that E. Honda has massive flaws. Frontliners like Angelic Gories and Gabriels are fast pushers, and will immediately recover from his Knockback, rendering his KB against them rather useless. His rather low DPS and damage make for poor offenses. Because of his long cooldown and subpar base bulk (for a melee Tanker), he has no generalist value. Even Green Shell can perform better than him as a generalist Tanker. He also struggles on mixed stages for these reasons. Curse hurts him too, and his low range makes him vulnerable to it. While he has the build of a tanky speedy rebound Rusher like Ganglion, his subpar KB count and low damage per hit make him useless for that role."
"E. Honda's usage is limited to a handful of stages, and beyond them you'll get no value out of him. His general usage is non-existent, and even his specialist use is very niche. His physical stats cannot make up for his long cooldown; and his mishmash stats have no synergy, making him good for practically no role."
