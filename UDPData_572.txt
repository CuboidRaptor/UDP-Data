Balrog,4,Ubers and Legends
"Balrog is a powerful Midranger Uber that has Target Only towards Red, Black and Zombies with 400 range and 10.5k DPS, 20 Speed, and 68k HP with 4 KBs. He also has the Zombie Killer ability and a low deploy cost at 2190, though a 145s CD."
"Balrog has quite high DPS, comparable to that of the best generalists. He also has quite high HP, allowing him to take a good few hits and utilize all his KBs, ensuring he does not exit the battle prematurely. He also has good speed, allowing him to stay in the frontline. His foreswing is very short, at just half a second, which is especially useful in quickly getting a hit off against burrowing Zombies and keeping Black enemies from pushing with their high speed and low endurance. He is also very cheap to deploy, one of the cheapest of any non-First Form Uber, which helps in cash-tight Zombie stages. All of these qualities combined allow for Balrog to save you in a tough situation very quickly."
"While Balrog's DPS is fairly high, he only targets Red, Black and Zombie, causing him to be only usable in some stages, and those stages without a strong presence of these traits he will not be usable on at all. Also, on the scale of Target Only units/nukers, Balrog is on the lower end of DPS and this especially shows against the Red target, where enemies tend to be rather bulky. Balrog's high speed also causes him to clip a fair bit, often leaving him in a position that can be vulnerable to longer ranged enemies. His cooldown is also a bit longer than that of an average Uber, making him often not able to be spawned again when the previous one is gone, and detracts from his cheap deploy cost."
"Balrog is a powerful unit against his traits with interesting and unique qualities and can easily save you in tight situations or even just generally against those traits. However, outside of his traits he is useless because of his Target Only."
