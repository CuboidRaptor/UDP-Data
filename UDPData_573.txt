Vega,4,Ubers and Legends
"Vega is a niche Backliner LD anti-Metal Uber with 450 standing range, 25 Speed, 42.5k HP with 5 KBs and 1700 base DPS with LD extending from 350 range to 800. He has a 100% chance to proc Freeze against Metals for 2.5s (3s with full treasures) and a 30% chance to perform a Critical Hit. His CD is 131s."
"Vega's main strength is his Freeze proc, with a 43% base uptime (51% with treasure). While Metal CC is often replaceable by cyclone drops, Vega's CC has the advantages of a 100% chance and affecting a large area with his LD reach. Vega also has 1050 effective DPS vs Metals, a respectable amount that is only a bit lower than other anti-Metal Ubers like Hayabusa or Nanaho. He has a good standing range, and high LD pierce area, though the necessity of this may come into question as Metal enemies tend to have low range. His high KB count also allows him to reposition frequently."
"Vega's main flaw is that his inner range is quite low, at just 100 range, which can cause Vega to miss short range units (which just so happen to be the category Metal enemies fall in) more often than you would like. This is coupled with his high speed, though his speed is not as big of an issue as other fast units as he does have a fair bit of foreswing. As happens with most anti-Metal Ubers, Vega also has very low general DPS, at less than half the average DPS of even LD Ubers making him generally useless outside of Metals."
"Vega is made for countering Metal enemies, especially on stages where the use of your regular anti-Metal non-Ubers may not work as well. While he has the issue of his inner range to contend with, Vega is still one of the best anti-Metal Ubers. In general use however, you will not find much use for him given his low DPS causing him to be outclassed by just about most other things."
