Sagat,4,Ubers and Legends
"Sagat is a poor midrange attacker with the ability of Massive Damage against Floating enemies. He has 61k HP with 4 KBs, 4700 base DPS with a 3.8s attack rate and 4f foreswing, and a +50% Strengthen, triggering at half health. He also has 350 range, 17 Speed, 4125 cost, and an 81s Cooldown."
"With full treasures, Sagat can deliver 18.6k effective DPS against Floating enemies, which jumps to 28k post-Strengthen. His fast attack cycle with almost no foreswing allows him to juggle groups of hard-pushing Floating enemies such as Li'l Bun Bun, particularly on stages such as Trouble at the Mansion. His relatively fast speed helps him get to the frontline quickly and do this job efficiently."
"Despite looking like a very promising unit at first, Sagat's general DPS is far too low for a Midranger and even with his Strengthen activated, it is only average at 7000 DPS. Due to this, his general use is nearly non-existent, and a stack of Cameraman Cats more than sufficiently fills the role of midrange anti-Floating DPS, making owning Sagat at most a nice bonus, but never all that needed. To add insult to injury, his recharge is quite long compared to other Midrangers and his high speed combined with mediocre range gives him suicidal tendencies, so he doesn't stay on the field as long as you'd ideally want."
"Sagat is a mediocre, replaceable anti-Floating Nuker with fatally low base DPS and survivability for a general Midranger. Strengthen helps offset this, but losing 50% of his health just to reach merely average midrange DPS is too much of a tradeoff to be truly worth it. A disappointing unit."
