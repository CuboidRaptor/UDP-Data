Hatsune Miku: MM2020 Tokyo,4,Ubers and Legends
"Tokyo Miku is a ranged Wave Blocker with 350 range, 97k HP, 3 KBs and Resistance towards Red and Angels. She will destroy the majority of wave stages and can act as a Tanker when needed, especially towards her target traits. However, her usage outside of those roles is minimal, with 5600 DPS and a 145s Cooldown."
"Tokyo Miku's biggest selling point is her 350 range and Wave Blocker ability. This allows her to avoid the normal attack for the majority of wave enemies, letting her block the waves and not die with sufficient meatshielding. Even if the enemies are pushing, she has a respectable enough KB count which allows her to survive enough time to kill the main threat or summon another one of her. Her 500k effective HP allows her to tank Red and Angels well and is especially effective against wave enemies of these traits, such as Berserkory. All of this makes her one of the best anti-Wave units in the game; able to turn even otherwise bad lineups into braindead free wins on almost every wave-based stage."
"While Tokyo Miku's 350 range lets her stay safe out of wave enemies' attacks, it also means she cannot act as a frontline Tanker, and will be more of a second line of defense. Her DPS is relatively low for this range. Her KB count also comes back to hurt her as a Wave Blocker; when KB'd, waves are not blocked, which can lead to waves leaking and damaging your Backliners. She also has somewhat lacking HP compared to many Tankers, which makes her hard to use as a general Tanker."
"Overall, Tokyo Miku is an excellent unit for many wave stages, and a nice second line of defense for her target traits. However, she is somewhat lacking outside of wave stages compared to other units with similar range or roles. That being said, being able to destroy the majority of wave stages is not something that can be ignored."
