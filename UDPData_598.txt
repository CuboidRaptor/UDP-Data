Ryoga Hibiki (Pig),4,Ubers and Legends
"Ryoga Hibiki has two forms with different usages. In First Form (Pig Form), Ryoga Hibiki (Pig) is a bad spammable melee anti-Black/Metal Uber with Resistance and a 50% proc chance to Knockback Black and Metal enemies. Ryoga (Pig) has 20k base HP, 2600 DPS, 25 Speed, 2 KBs and an 11 second recharge. In Evolved Form (Human Form), Ryoga Hibiki is a bad Backliner with Resistance and a guaranteed Knockback to Black and Metal enemies, as well as a 3% chance for a Critical Hit. He has 61k HP, 4700 DPS, 480 range, 2 KBs, 17 Speed, and a 145 second recharge."
"Ryoga (Human)'s only strength is his range, on the high end for a Backliner, letting him outrange most regular enemies and making him valuable in the early game to hit enemies like SLOTH and Master A, which Crazed Bahamut can't be used against."
"Ryoga (Pig) doesn't offer anything. He has too long cooldown to be used as a meatshield and too low range and high speed to be stacked as a damager. Besides that, both of Ryogaâ€™s forms have bad trait targeting for his ability. Knockback ability doesn't work well against Black enemies since most of them have a lot of knockbacks anyway, and there are better Metal CC options such as cyclone drop cats. Ryoga (Human)'s high range makes him unusable as a Tanker as he usually stands behind most of your attackers, and even if you wanted to tank Metal or Black enemies, 310k effective HP wouldn't last too long anyway. For general usage, his performance is far from satisfactory. His DPS is not impressive, and having 2 KBs means he only gets to reposition once before he dies. This makes him easily replaceable by most other Nuker Ubers, and barely better than regular Crazed Bahamut."
"In conclusion, Ryoga Hibiki doesn't have a good niche, or good general use due to subpar stats and some key weaknesses. His noteworthy uses will largely be early game backline work for people lacking alternatives, but he is otherwise rather useless."
