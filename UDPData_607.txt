Adventurer Kanna,4,Ubers and Legends
"Adventurer Kanna is a good anti-Black Sniper that deals Massive Damage to Black enemies, with LD from 300 to 700 range, and 400 standing range. Kanna has a three-stage multi-hit attack that generates a level 2 Surge on first hit, spawning between 400 and 700 range. In Evolved Form, Swashbuckler Kanna has 47k HP with 3 KBs, 2600 base DPS (surge not included), and 12 Speed. She also has a 131 second long Cooldown, and a 4725 spawn cost."
"Kanna works well as an anti-Black Uber. She boasts a high 17k effective LD DPS towards Black enemies, including surge. She can easily cripple high endurance Black foes such as Le’Noir and Dark Otter, while juggling low endurance Black enemies with her high attack rate, and effective 5 hits per attack cycle with surge included. Unlike certain multi-hit Ubers, she doesn't miss too often thanks to a decent amount of time between multi-hit attacks and a huge 300 piercing range, so that enemies can walk back into range after getting knocked back. Kanna is also usable as a general Sniper with a decent 4300 effective LD DPS, provided all hits and surges land, with sufficient range to hit most backliner enemies with a stepping stone."
"One of the weaknesses of Kanna is that her effective DPS is lower on low endurance Black enemies as they are not being hit by all her attacks while they are juggled. Kanna also has a fairly large blindspot, making her vulnerable to fast, low range pushers, like Black Gory swarms. It is also fair to say that simply killing Black enemies quickly is not that valuable due to the dominance of Pizza (especially with talents) in this niche. Kanna might also lose her range advantage due to clipping, as her high speed and short backswing make her advance prematurely. This means her KBs could be consumed rather quickly and her time on the field might not be long. Lastly, Kanna's general usage suffers from lower than average base DPS among Snipers of her range, which, combined with her other weaknesses, makes her largely replaceable by Awakened Mina in late game."
"In a nutshell, Kanna works well against Black enemies with her juggling ability and effective LD DPS, though offers little in this department that Pizza doesn't other than a convenience against longer-ranged Black threats like Le’noir. Kanna doesn't perform so well outside of them due to low stats, but could still work as a general Sniper if you have no one else."
