Raiden,4,Ubers and Legends
"Raiden is a decent anti-Red Backliner with 68k base HP, 6000 base DPS, and 415 range in True Form. Raiden also boasts a 100% KB proc against Reds, 3 knockbacks, a 2 minute Cooldown, and a decent 15 Speed."
"With a guaranteed KB proc, Raiden can juggle menacing melee Red units like JK Bun Buns, Shy Boys, Bores, and Berserkories along with its great effective 11k DPS. Thanks to a good effective 170k HP and resulting 57k endurance, Raiden can also power through some attacks with its decent endurance. Outside of the Red niche, Raiden has serviceable stats to work as a generalist as long as its short 415 range for a Backliner doesn't matter against the enemies of the stage."
"Unfortunately, Raiden still suffers from multiple weaknesses. For one, its cooldown is rather long for its mediocre range. His range is on the low end for a Backliner and this gives less room for error if the frontline falters, and while his KB count is okay, it doesnâ€™t grant the greatest survivability. This is offset by its quick time between attacks and good effective HP against Reds, but means it performs underwhelmingly against other traits. With his guaranteed Knockback, there is always the chance that Raiden pushes your entire army into the enemy backliner's range and gets you killed, but thankfully this is rare against Red enemies."
"Overall, Raiden remains a decent Uber to have against most Red enemies with pure stats and consistent CC procs. It can do an adequate job fulfilling both the damage and CC rolled into a single unit. While Raiden has okay generalist stats, it falls short in stages where its 415 range could really handicap its potential. Nothing about its stats make Raiden stand out from other ubers save for its less than 450 range. Despite these shortcomings, Raiden remains one of the stronger Ubers, especially from the Dragon Emperors set."
